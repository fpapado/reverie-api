Later:
- Handle/present sent stickers for a user. Delete?
- Name / Surname
- Pull default author name if logged in to app
- Decide on json-api view structure;
  is there a single view we could use instead of our own defs?

- Figure out indexes, especially for stickers (sender, receiver, category)

- decide where to put default includes (DSL vs controller)
- decide whether those includes should be default
  - Currently, we include them anyway in Ember, even if not needed.
    Easier to change without breaking

- consistent pluralization in serializing,
- consistent pluralization in controllers,
- consistent pluralization in Ember,
- show.json-api deprecation,

- Categories: add long-form message / explanation?
- Open or closed indexing of users?

- add references to children in parent schemas (+migration for db table)
- add assoc_constraint([:sender, :receiver]),
    see: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html#assoc_constraint/3

- [Feature] Add "hidden" sticker categories, that are awarded by admins
- build_receiver_relationship handle function not found
  (we don't need to, I suppose, but rendering errors is nice)
- Sticker message consider, max 150 chars
