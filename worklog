Further work: better stickers
1) Add indexing for categories; this would help Ember listing
2) Consider removing "title" from sticker; handled by category?

  Sticker
    title [Should remove?]
    belongs_to Category
      title
      url

  [NYI] Optional params:
    message
      validation: 150 chars

Add send/receive method:
  name: enum['a', 'b', 'c'] |> validate

- Handle/present sent stickers for a user

Later:
- Decide on json-api view structure;
  is there a single view we could use instead of our own defs?

- Figure out indexes, especially for stickers (sender, receiver, category)

- decide where to put default includes (DSL vs controller)
- decide whether those includes should be default
  - Currently, we include them anyway in Ember, even if not needed.
    Easier to change without breaking

- consistent pluralization in serializing,
- consistent pluralization in controllers,
- consistent pluralization in Ember,
- show.json-api deprecation,

- Categories: add long-form message / explanation?
- Open or closed indexing of users?

- add references to children in parent schemas (+migration for db table)
- add assoc_constraint([:sender, :receiver]),
